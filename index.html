      My Dearest Love,

      Hi bebii happy 13th monthsary! I knew that every month Ill get to celebrate this kind of celebration because I know that

      we will be together till forever and eternity. Not playing it as a boastful and bad approach but the feeling and trust we 

      have already in just a year. Also I am confident that I will always be present on your side whether you need me or not. I 

      will allways take care of you and guide you whenever youre lost in your thoughts and will cheer you up to get back on your 

      feet. I will never get tired reciprocating and giving you what you deserve, in things, in love, in joy, and in everything. 

      Im trying all my best to keep up in your pace, in which, being great and perfect. Im always sincere in my mistakes and in 

      asking forgiveness. I dont force our fights, its just so happens that Im so much and mistaken. Im sorry again for all the 

      inconvenience I caused you. There will be more and more monthsaries to come hunny. I wont stay stagnant, but to always be 

      better. Change is always constant and that will make us even stronger together. Dont worry in everything baby, just do 

      what youre doing, will support you and call out if youre in the wrong. I will keep pushing you forward until you get what 

      deserve. I love you very very very much, till eternity hunny. Im so proud of you my little one. Happy Happy 13 months my 

      Louiela. Staying in love like day 1 is the only thing that wont change I guarantee you pretty baby. I hope and pray that all

      your problems within family and yourself will always be solved! God gave me you and I will always cherish it!
